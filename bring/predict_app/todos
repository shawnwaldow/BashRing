#################DONE###########################################

#########FROM MVP PUSH###################
the models are done for the database we designed. two api calls partially populate the DB. These two steps took about two weeks of class time, but class had little usable programming time for various sorted reasons.

*EZ, 2hrs(really 4)
-improve db to include more fields like headliner
-->11:10=3:22 ended up MEDIUM. No more DB changes unless absolutely necesary.
$4.2

*EZ, 3 hrs
-improve dummy data a bit
-->11:00am=1:35 discovered it isn't simple because the ufc dosent provide very comprehensive api data in json for fighters. Also found an error in my weight class class. fixing that now... Well it took me 2.5 hours which was less than the 3 I predicted. That's good.
$2.5

*EZ 2 hrs.
-make a page that shows all cards to predict each and the headliner
-->Here we go 2:30pm=10:10pm. Included a couple argr%YmaeERTTH hours.
$6

*EZ distributed 3 hrs (really 6 which is the doubling estimate. That's what it took!)
-setup minipc as capstone backup.
-->here we go 10:15am=4pm For one thing you had to add your new computers home user to postgress. For another you had to install pillow which took a bunch of backing libraries installed outside the venv then you had to be back in the venv and ignore the high google results instructions and simply follow the error message kicked out by django's test server. Finished about 4 pm.
$5

*EZ 5hrs
-make a page that shows all the bouts on a card with a button to predict each
-->7:15=10:15Here we go. Going to try this using brute force without filters for 2 solid hours. Will redirect to learning filters if I am not almost done by 9:15... well i finished the brute force at 8:15 and spent the next two hours troubleshooting the url argument passing. Still have a problem with the use of {% url %} project wide... Fixed the url problem. 1 hour with 20 minutes of chris's help.
$4

*MEDIUM very similar to pollsite. very important. 6hrs (doubles to 12)
-make a page that collects the prediction for a single bout
-->here we go 11am...12:10 chuncked out essentail data display. lunch 1:10-1:40 2:30-4:30 5:30-6:00 9:30-10:30 adapted and abandoned a pretty javascript bar display 3.5 hours digression.10:30-1:30 adapted pollsite to data collection. Semi-successful but have a weird bug where the page submits automatically. We are at 7.5 hours which is still shy of the the bad case.--->Get help. If fix easy then load the json to DB how? 3hrs? Well it took 3 hours to get unstuck and do 90% of the handing things from JS and JSON with ajax to the view controller and instantiating a new user_prediction. move round_won prediction to stretch goals. Now fix the fact that win by sub got left out. Then figure out how to get at the methods const objects gracefully. Then add a indication to the two prediction pages that a particular bout has been predicted. Now at 10 hours. But it looks like we will finish. 7:02 finished. 13hrs total!
$13

*EZ 1 hr
-Learn how to interact with postgres directly and or modify admin page more. Currently locked out somehow. This should actually be a stretch goal.
-->.75 hour chris set me up with pycharm and gave me access to a different postgres DB. Admin page is now wayyyyy better
$1.5

*EZ with help. 3 hrs.
-ADD USERS. according to chris: the sticking point is integrating users and the things they can do into the finished product you already have.
-->11:19 working casually.11:43 breakingdown 
$*

*EZ but time 4hrs
Make two FAKE CARDS with fake fighters with fake bouts and enter predictictions corresponding for three users. Then enter fake results. OR push a realcard up in starttime after preserving data tables.
-->9:11pm-10:11... add some clark griswald predictions?
-->$*

*MEDIUM probaly only 2 hrs though
-REFACTOR display card and display bouts to use more filters less for loops
-->$*

*FIX error with url length for avatars. Done changed default avatar.
-->$*

*calculatewinners
-->$

*calculate predictioncorrectness
-->$

*EZ or MEDIUM 4 hrs when done towards end after user creation.
-make a LANDING. Must calc results of past predictions. that shows your averages, results, and predictions 
-->$
